<h4>Here is an overall summary of the software I've been using in my career. During my time as an intern for ADB Companies, I've had experience in many types of software and technology that has improved my knowledge base.</h4>

<h4> Esri Products:</h4> 
ArcGIS Pro, Arc Enterprise, Arcpy tools, Survey123

<p>Above is an automated print that I would frequently have to make, and I made it by using an in house tool called the Auto Print Tool in ArcGIS Pro. To run the tool you need to choose your json file, map scale, title,
defintion query, area of interest field, area of interest attribute, and a grid layer. These prints were used by designers at the company to give to customers for early drafts for the engineering jobs.</p>

<h4>Render Networks</h4>
<img src="https://github.com/max1sing/max1sing/blob/main/newrender.png?raw=true" alt="yes" width="700" height="400">
<p>I've used Render Networks to change points and polygons to update our field workers in each specific jobs. The project above is our contract for the Ritter Expressway in Arkansas and Oklahoma, 
and some of the daily tasks that I would handle with Render would be pushing data and shapefiles into Render from ArcPro and finding segments along the highway that need to be updated or changed.</p>

<h4>Katapult Pro</h4>

<img src="https://github.com/max1sing/max1sing/blob/main/katapult2.png?raw=true" alt="yes" width="250" height="400" /> 
</p>
<p>I've used Katapult Pro Maps to design, calibrate, and trace routes for connected fiber within aerial midspans and poles. Using Katapult has allowed me to critically think about the way shapefiles are mapped
and how important symbology is for engineers and project managers.</p>
