<p>This tool was created by someone at ADB and it auto populates the grid layers that are needed for a certain area in a job and I've helped improve the usuablilty of the tool for the engineering team</p>

<p>I used Render Networks to change points and polygons to update our field workers in each specific jobs. The project above is our contract for the Ritter Expressway in Arkansas and Oklahoma, 
and some of the daily tasks that I would handle with Render would be pushing data and shapefiles into Render from ArcPro and finding segments along the highway that need to be updated or changed.</p>
