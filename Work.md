## My experience

I really enjoyed the time I spent at all of the jobs that I've had over the past couple of years. All of the jobs I worked at were because people I knew had worked for that company. I took pleasure in working for the companies that I worked for and enjoyed making several new friends while I was there. The work force is invloving and makes the summer months not pass as slow as they normally would. I plan on having a new job this summer or possibly an internship!
